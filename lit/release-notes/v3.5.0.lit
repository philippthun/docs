\release{2017-9-19}{3.5.0}{1.6.0}{
  \note{feature,security}{
    Those of you using our BOSH release have been stuck with either our
    way-out-of-date-and-vulnerable-to-thousands-of-CVEs-and-EOL-next-year
    version of Postgres (9.3), or an external Postgres server. NO LONGER!

    We've enabled an upgrade path to the \link{CloudFoundry Postgres BOSH
    release}{https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release}, which is
    up-to-date (currently 9.6.4) and even supports release-to-release upgrade
    paths!

    \warn{
      The next version of Concourse will require version 9.5+ of Postgres, so
      action is required either now or upon the next release to upgrade.

      The \code{postgresql} job in our release should now be considered
      deprecated, and will be removed in the next release.
    }

    To switch off from our pitiful pre-packaged precarious Postgres, do the
    following:

    \list{
      First, deploy this version of Concourse with no changes. We have modified
      our Postgres job to move its data to a new location that the Cloud
      Foundry Postgres release will upgrade from.
    }{
      After the deploy has finished, upload the Cloud Foundry Postgres release.
      We've tested the upgrade path with version 20, available on
      \link{bosh.io}{http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release?version=20}.
    }{
      Once the release is uploaded, add it to your deployment manifest, swap
      out the \code{concourse/postgresql} job for the \code{postgres/postgres}
      job, and update the ATC properties to explicitly configure the database
      and role. (That's a mouthful, but you can use \link{our changes to the
      single-vm
      manifest}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/commit/17be5f144a799e344c9d1bb56d9595ff164c96ef}
      as a reference.)
    }{
      Note that the Postgres DB upgrade must not be combined in the same deployment operation with a stemcell update.
    }
  }

  \note{feature}{
    Concourse now supports
    \link{CredHub}{https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub} for
    external credential management. See \reference{credhub} for more
    information.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    GC no longer creates crazy seesaw patterns with containers and volumes.
    This was an issue that was introduced in v3.4.1 when 2 or more teams have
    identically configured resources. It's been fixed now.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed a leak with goroutines that happens from \reference{fly-intercept}
  }

  \note{feature}{
    When using groups in pipelines, \code{fly} will now let you know when you
    forgot to assign a job to a group. Say goodbye to hidden pipelines!
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Jobs and resources with a forward slash in their name no longer error out
    when loading their details.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    The \resource{semver} now supports Google Cloud Storage. Thanks
    \ghuser{chendrix}!
  }

  \note{fix}{
    The \resource{s3} correctly shows the progress of uploading and
    downloading. It will no longer report 2 TB/s. Thanks \ghuser{krishicks}!
  }
}
